This project consist of a number of function whose objective is to make us, learners, understand the basics of assembly. The function where previously made in C language, on the project named libft, and now they must be rewritten in ASM.



For those who are starting the project and don't know where to start, I linked to the image below a Notion I created to help students on their first steps in this project.
